ssh 
   -N Do not execute a remote command.  This is useful for just forwarding ports (protocol version 2 only).
   -f Requests ssh to go to background just before command execution.  This is useful if ssh is going to ask for passwords or passphrases, but the user wants it in the background.  This implies -n.  The recommended way to start X11 programs at a remote site is with something like ssh -f host xterm.

1. -L -L [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
   Specifies that the given port on the local (client) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the remote side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the local side, optionally bound to the specified bind_address.  Whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port hostport from the remote machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.  IPv6 addresses can be specified with an alternative syntax: [bind_address/]port/host/hostport or by enclosing the address in square brackets.  Only the superuser can forward privileged ports.  By default, the local port is bound in accordance with the GatewayPorts setting.  However, an explicit bind_address may be used to bind the connection to a specific address.  The bind_address of “localhost” indicates that the listening port be bound for local use only, while an empty address or ‘*’ indicates that the port should be avail- able from all interfaces.

2. -R [bind_address:]port:host:hostport
      Specifies that the given port on the remote (server) host is to be forwarded to the given host and port on the local side.  This works by allocating a socket to listen to port on the remote side, and whenever a connection is made to this port, the connection is forwarded over the secure channel, and a connection is made to host port hostport from the local machine.  Port forwardings can also be specified in the configuration file.  Privileged ports can be for- warded only when logging in as root on the remote machine.  IPv6 addresses can be specified by enclosing the address in square braces or using an alternative syntax: [bind_address/]host/port/hostport.  By default, the listening socket on the server will be bound to the loopback interface only.  This may be overridden by specifying a bind_address.  An empty bind_address, or the address ‘*’, indicates that the remote socket should listen on all interfaces.  Specifying a remote bind_address will only succeed if the server’s GatewayPorts option is enabled (see sshd_config(5)).  

      If the port argument is ‘0’, the listen port will be dynamically allocated on the server and reported to the client at run time.
