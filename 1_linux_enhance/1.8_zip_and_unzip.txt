1. unzip -d dir
can change extract file to spec directory, that after option '-d' must be a directory.
2. view gz, zip, bzip... extention files with less, but gz, bzip can see file content, and less *.zip just like ls -l, and we can see percent of compressed.

e.g.
[root@centos ~]# unzip -d install.log.zip /tmp/
unzip:  cannot find or open /tmp/, /tmp/.zip or /tmp/.ZIP.
[root@centos ~]# unzip install.log.zip -d /tmp
Archive:  install.log.zip
  inflating: /tmp/install.log        
  [root@centos ~]# ls /tmp/install.log 
  /tmp/install.log
  [root@centos ~]#
