USER: 用户
PID: 进程ID
$CPU: CPU使用百分比
$MEM: 内存占用百分比
VSZ: 虚拟内存大小 virtual memory size of the process in KiB (1024-byte units). Devicemappings are currently excluded; this is subject to change.  (alias vsize).
RSS: 真实内存大小 resident set size, the non-swapped physical memory that a task has used (in kiloBytes). (alias rssize, rsz).
TTY: ?表示后台，其它的表示虚拟终端(pts0...n)或者是CONSOLE登录(tty0...n)
STAT:
PROCESS STATE CODES
       Here are the different values that the s, stat and state output specifiers (header "STAT" or "S") will display to describe the state of a process.
           D    Uninterruptible sleep (usually IO)
           R    Running or runnable (on run queue)
           S    Interruptible sleep (waiting for an event to complete)
           T    Stopped, either by a job control signal or because it is being traced.
           W    paging (not valid since the 2.6.xx kernel)
           X    dead (should never be seen)
           Z    Defunct ("zombie") process, terminated but not reaped by its parent.

          For BSD formats and when the stat keyword is used, additional characters may be displayed:
           <    high-priority (not nice to other users)
           N    low-priority (nice to other users)
           L    has pages locked into memory (for real-time and custom IO)
           s    is a session leader（主进程）
           l    is multi-threaded (using CLONE_THREAD, like NPTL pthreads do)
           +    is in the foreground process group
START: 启动时间
TIME: 占用cpu的时间
COMMAND: 进程名
