1. 说明
    The Docker package is available via the EPEL repository. These instructions work for CentOS 6 and later. They will likely work for other binary compatible EL6 distributions such as Scientific Linux, but they haven't been tested.  Please note that this package is part of Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL), a community effort to create and maintain additional packages for the RHEL distribution.  Also note that due to the current Docker limitations, Docker is able to run only on the ==>64 bit architecture<==.  To run Docker, you will need CentOS6 or higher, with a kernel version 2.6.32-431 or higher as this has specific kernel fixes to allow Docker to run.
注意：只能是在64位的机器上安装
