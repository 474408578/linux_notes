1. If you wanna to download a rpm package you can use this command
    yum install -y downloadonly
    yum install -y package_name --downloadonly --downloaddir=PREFIX
   If that package is already installed, then you can use this command, Because it's only can download not install on local by default. 
    yum reinstall -y package_name --downloadonly --downloaddir=PREFIX
