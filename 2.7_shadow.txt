1、what's the password encrypt in /etc/shadow on Centos6?
	Answer: sha-512
2、What's flags '!!' and '*' mean second field in /et/shadow?
	Answer: '!!' mean is this account not set password, '*' mean's this account is be locked, inactive.
3、which mean the 5th field int /etc/shadow?
	Answer: maximum password age
           The maximum password age is the number of days after which the user will have to change her password.

           After this number of days is elapsed, the password may still be valid. The user should be asked to change
           her password the next time she will log in.

           An empty field means that there are no maximum password age, no password warning period, and no password
           inactivity period (see below).

           If the maximum password age is lower than the minimum password age, the user cannot change her password.
	
This bellow is my test.
Changed the login user wilsh maxinum password age to zero.
[root@server ~]# cat /etc/shadow | grep -i wilsh
wilsh:$6$lVvOv7uq$RcEufCoSN07SYSzTbKT.k1j.OxMc9hYhyy0JC8soWJ8LCHRuVRGJFdVr9dOxM.T1IT5drUglIGwepuAbiP9cA0:16796:0:0:7:::
[root@server ~]# 

Current Date:
[root@server ~]# date +%F
2016-01-17
Then I modified it:
[root@server ~]# date -s "2016-01-18 12:00:00"
