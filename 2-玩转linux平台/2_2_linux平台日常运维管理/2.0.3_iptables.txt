--table table
  This option specifies the packet matching table which the command should operate on.  If the kernel is configured with automatic module load- ing, an attempt will be made to load the appropriate module for that table if it is not already there.
The tables are as follows:

  filter: This is the default table (if no -t option is passed). It contains the built-in chains INPUT (for packets  destined  to  local  sockets), FORWARD (for packets being routed through the box), and OUTPUT (for locally-generated packets).

  nat: This  table  is  consulted  when  a packet that creates a new connection is encountered.  It consists of three built-ins: PREROUTING (for altering packets as soon as they come in), OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing), and POSTROUTING (for  altering packets as they are about to go out).

   mangle: This  table is used for specialized packet alteration.  Until kernel 2.4.17 it had two built-in chains: PREROUTING (for altering incoming packets before routing) and OUTPUT (for altering locally-generated packets before routing).  Since kernel 2.4.18,  three  other  built-in chains  are  also supported: INPUT (for packets coming into the box itself), FORWARD (for altering packets being routed through the box), and POSTROUTING (for altering packets as they are about to go out).

  raw: This table is used mainly for configuring exemptions from connection tracking in combination with the NOTRACK target.   It  registers  at the  netfilter  hooks  with  higher  priority  and is thus called before ip_conntrack, or any other IP tables.  It provides the following built-in chains: PREROUTING (for packets arriving via any network interface) OUTPUT (for packets generated by local processes)

1.如何将本地80端口的请求转发到8080端口,当前主机IP为192.168.16.1,其中本地网卡eth0:
答：
#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 192.168.16.1 -p tcp –dport 80 -j DNAT –to 192.168.16.1:8080
或 者：
#iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -d 192.168.16.1 -p tcp -m tcp –dport 80 -j REDIRECT –to-ports 8080
铭哥，这个题答案怎么理解呢？2种答案-j 分别用了DNAT和REDIRECT，有什么区别？

 因为用的很少，所以没有啥印象，今天看了一下我觉得像是这样的： DNAT后面跟的是IP:port ，可以只写IP，REDIRECT后面跟的是端口
